Implementation of Unitary Recurrent Neural Networks for various toy tasks and language modelling.
===
This repository contains our implementation of unitary RNNs for various toy tasks and language modelling on the Penn Treebank dataset, as outlined in Arjovsky et al. paper [Unitary Evolution Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06464). Refer to the READMEs of the respective tasks for more information on how to run each task.
